    This section explores how various features relate to Bitcoin price using:
    - **Spearman Correlation**: tells us the monotonic relationship between features i.e. as one increases, the other increases or decreases, but not necessarily at the same rate.
    - **Pearson Correlation**: Measures linear relationships
    - **Predictive Power Score (PPS)**: Detects predictive strength, even for non-linear patterns
